= Janus version 3

Janus is the official SARL run-time environment.

The third version of Janus is completely rewritten in SARL programming language,
and provides specific implementation optimizations.

The major differences with the version 2 (current official version) are:

- Implementation language: **SARL** instead of Java
- **Simplified framework** architecture (network support is removed, and assumed to be provided by third party libraries)
- Use of the **Bootique framework** to make easier the booting process and the module extension by third parties.
- Optimization into the background code to be faster.
